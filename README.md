# Project-C
This is my first Git repository and first project upload 
Introduction: 
-------------
         This project gives the blood report of the patients which includes the name, age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, platelet count, t-RBC count, white blood cells count and blood group. By giving an antigen value we will get the blood group. In this program we used a file pointer to create and write a file in which the report is saved. We used struct patient to give the details of the patient like name, age, gender etc. Introduced a structure array to store two or more patient's details. Using for loop to enter the input of n number of patient details at a time and save in the report. Maximum limit is for thousand patients at a time. This will be helpful for laboratory people who tests the blood samples from the patients.

Purpose: 
---------
        Purpose of this program is to give the details of the blood to the patients as a report. It helps them to know their haemoglobin count, platelet count and many other details. This will be very helpful for laboratory people who wants to give a blood report to the patients.

Algorithm: 
-----------
              This is a C program that inputs data for multiple patients and outputs their medical reports to a text file named “BloodReport.txt”. The program takes the patient’s name, age, gender, height, weight, platelet count, T-RBC count, and white blood cell count. The body mass index (BMI) is also calculated and displayed in the report. The reports are stored in the specified text file, each separated by a series of asterisks. The use of the scanf and fprintf functions are used to read and write the data respectively. The program also includes the struct type definition to create a structure called patient which holds the patient’s medical data. It consists of two functions report which caluclates the blood report after entering the results of antigen and  program defines the display function which outputs the patient’s report in the text file.
